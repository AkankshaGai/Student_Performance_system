# Student_Performance_system

- Data analysis plays a vital role in understanding scope of improvement and current performance, serves as a major protocol in accreditation process of universities.Traditionally, the student database is analyzed and reported using MS-excel or Spreadsheet. This process is totally manual and requires the faculty to develop tables and understand information manually which is prone to error and inefficient. This system can be improved by developing a web application consisting of the databaseand reports generating function based on pre-defining the operations performed on the database. The parameters can be obtained from students marksheet.
- Spout Library is used.
- This project is same domain specific and restricted to engineering.
